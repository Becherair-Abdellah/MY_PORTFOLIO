      "body": "This book is not about JavaScript engines or virtual machines. It is about the lan-\nguage itself and the things every programmer should know about it. This book is a\nradical reappraisal of JavaScript, how it works, how it could be made better, and how\nit can be better used. It is about how to think about JavaScript and how to think in\nJavaScript. I am going to pretend that the current version of the language is the only\nversion. I am not going to waste your time by showing how things worked in ES1 or\nES3 or ES5. That does not matter. The focus is on how JavaScript works for us now.\nThis book is not comprehensive. There are large, complex chunks of the language that\nwill be dismissed without a word. If I fail to mention your most favorite feature, that\nis most likely because that feature is crap. I will not be paying much attention to\nsyntax. I am assuming that you already know how to write an if statement. If you\nneed assistance with those sorts of details, ask JSLint. jslint.com\nThere are some useful parts of the language that I will spend little time on, such as\nmost of the methods in the primordial prototypes. There are excellent online reference\nmaterials for that. My favorite resource is Mozilla Foundation.",
