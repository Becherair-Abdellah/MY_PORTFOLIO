              I am Abdellah Becherair, a student at the Faculty of Computer Science in Algeria (University Kasdi Merbah) in my second year of university. Currently, I work as a front-end developer in the field of web development, thanks to my self-directed learning. My journey in web development began in 2019 when I started learning the basics of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I began designing templates and ready-made pages to enhance my practical experience at the start of my academic and professional journey.

              In 2020, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Experimental Science. After that, I joined the Faculty of Computer Science and began my academic journey there. I started learning algorithms and data structures as core subjects using the C language, along with other subjects like Information Systems, Algebra, and Analysis.

              In addition to my academic studies, I was learning web programming as a front-end developer. Now, I have experience in programming and developing professional and appealing user interfaces using technologies like React.js, Next.js, and my JavaScript skills.
